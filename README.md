#### To get started

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:9100/
```

#### Tasks:

* Implement blockClicked to (or hide) all blocks of the same colour that are connected to the target element.

Similar to Tetris but you have to click a block to have matching blocks removed.

E.g.,

Given:

![Initial state](https://trottski.s3.amazonaws.com/snaps/initial.jpg)

After clicking one of the bottom right blue boxes it should then look
like this:

![state 2](https://trottski.s3.amazonaws.com/snaps/stage2.jpg)
